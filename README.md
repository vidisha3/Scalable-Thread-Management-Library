#  Security Vulnerability Detection Framework
    Overview

The Security Vulnerability Detection Framework is a web-based application designed to detect, simulate, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This system helps developers and security analysts identify potential weaknesses in their applications and test their defenses against cyber threats.

        Features

    Vulnerability Detection Engine

-Scans for security vulnerabilities in System, Network, and Application layers.

-Supports Memory Analysis, Process Monitoring, File Integrity, and Buffer Overflow Detection.
-Customizable scan depth (Standard, Deep, Quick Scan).

    Attack Simulation System
-Simulates real-world cyberattacks (e.g., Buffer Overflow, SQL Injection, DoS attacks).

-Adjustable attack intensity levels.

-Safe Mode to prevent actual system damage.

    Security Metrics & Reports
-Provides insights into detected vulnerabilities categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

-Generates comprehensive reports with mitigation recommendations.

-Tracks recent security events and active alerts.

    System Status Monitoring
-Displays operational status of the Detection Engine, Attack Simulator, Alert System, and Mitigation Service.
